DESCRIPTION OF STEPS

1. In this step, I have loaded the CSV file created in the previous step as a table
 (named ghdata.hn_users_to_query_2dec16) in Google BigQuery so that I may filter Github 
 events to only includes those relevant users

2. I also copied the latest 2016 githubarchive data to my tables so that I can query against
 the most recent posts now that the scope is reduced

3. I then created a query to download all events filtered by those users between 2012 and 2016 but without
the payload. I ran the following query

SELECT type, repo.name, repo.url, actor.login, org.login, created_at
  FROM
  (SELECT * FROM
    [ghdata.2012],
    [ghdata.2013],
    [ghdata.2014],
    [ghdata.2015],
    [ghdata.201601],
    [ghdata.201602],
    [ghdata.201603],
    [ghdata.201604],
    [ghdata.201605],
    [ghdata.201606],
    [ghdata.201607],
    [ghdata.201608],
    [ghdata.201609],
    [ghdata.201610],
    [ghdata.201611])
  WHERE actor.login IN (SELECT gh_login
                        FROM [ghdata.hn_users_to_query_2dec16]
                        )

4. This generated 964993 rows and processed 76.2GB. I then downloaded the data (only 22mb in the end)
without the payload (can always do that again next time if useful)

5. I saved the data in 2.big_query_results
